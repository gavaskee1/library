<h2 id="#What_is_Credit_Card">What is Credit Card? </h2>
<p>A credit card is a plastic card issued by a bank or a financial institution to borrow funds at the cardholderâ€™s convenience. The maximum credit limit is typically pre-set by the bank at the time of card issuance. The cardholders are free to use the available funds as and when required. The maximum amount of funds can be used only for card purchases such as online transactions and offline transactions at merchant terminals. A small portion, however, is reserved for credit card cash withdrawal. </p>

<p>The cardholder has the option to repay the borrowed amount within the grace period, during which no interest will be charged, or he/she can opt for revolving credit which allows carrying forward unpaid amount to subsequent months and also charges interest on the same until the due is settled in full. </p>

<h2>Various Elements Printed on a Credit Card</h2>
<p>A credit card might look like any other card with number, logos and other information. But are you aware that each element on a credit card has a purpose? This section will help you understand the significance of each and every element printed on the front and rear side of a credit card.</p>
<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s discuss the elements on the front-side of a credit card.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Credit card number: </strong>The 16-digit number is one of the prominent elements of a credit card. If you think it&rsquo;s a random, machine-generated number, you&rsquo;re wrong. Each digit or a set of digits of the number not only provide specific information but are also used to identify the authenticity of the card, just by doing a simple math.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>The first digit of the 16-digit number is the Major Industry Identifier (MII) and indicates a specific industry that issued the card. For banking and financial institutions, the digits 4 and 5 are assigned by the regulatory. Hence most of the credit cards numbers issued in India begin with 4 and 5. While Visa credit cards begin with 4, MasterCard powered card begin with 5. American Express cards, on the other hand, begin with 3.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>The next 5 digits along with the first digit represent the issuer or the bank. They are thus called Issuer Identification Number or Bank Identification Number (BIN). Each bank uses a different sequence of IIN. Hence by looking at the first 6 digits, one can identify the issuing authority.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>The digits 7 to 15 contain the primary account number of the credit card. The number is unique for each cardholder. The number is crucial to identify the customer hence are often masked in all the bank communications.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <ul>
    <li>The last digit, the 16th, is called the check digit as it is used to check the accuracy of other digits on the card. The last digit can be generated by applying a mathematical formula called the Luhn Algorithm to the previous digits. One wrong number will give a different result and that&rsquo;s how inaccuracy of the digits will be identified.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The logos and names on the credit card: </strong>The next prominent components on a credit card are the issuer&rsquo;s logo, the name of the card, card networks such as Visa, MasterCard, RuPay, etc., the cardholder&rsquo;s name, and the validity date.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The chip and the contactless icon: </strong>These are the new entrants, we can say. With the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mandating the conversion of all magnetic stripe-only cards into EMV-chip-based cards, all the new credit cards issued after 31 January 2016 are chip based. If your card is upgraded, you can see an EMV chip on the front side.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another latest feature that has been introduced by credit card issuers is the contactless payment feature. If your card has the feature, you will find a symbol similar to a Wi-Fi symbol on your card.</p>
<p><strong>Now let&rsquo;s move on to the back-side of a credit card.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Magnetic stripe</strong>: Despite the introduction of EMV chip-based cards, the magnetic stripe, which carries all the crucial account information, still exists till the time all the retail terminals in India are upgraded to accept chip-based cards. This means, even though you receive a credit card very recently, it&rsquo;s likely that you will see both chip and stripe on your card.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>CVV: </strong>The CVV or Card Verification Value is a security code that is used as a fraud-prevention tool. The CVV is typically used for online or card-not-present transactions. While VISA and MasterCards have 3 digits in the CVV, Amex has 4 digits.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Signature box, hologram, and others: </strong>The signature box is another security feature on a credit card. Every cardholder needs to sign in the box to make the card legally valid. In case suspicious cases, the signature on the card will be cross verified with other signature proofs the cardholders carry.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hologram is the glittering little sticker that prevents physical copying of the card. It contains various layers with images imprinted at different angles. Its design makes it hard to copy using a scanner or other instrument. Hence, it also acts as another security feature on the card.</p>




<h2 id="Compare_Credit_Cards">How to Use a Credit Card</h2>
<p>Though the primary functionality of a credit card is to use it only for card-only transactions, such as to purchase goods or services at retail merchant terminals or online, the cash withdrawal feature offered on most the cards, allows the cardholders to withdraw a portion of the amount as cash from ATM. However, in both of the cases, the cardholders need a PIN (personal identification number) to process the transaction. </p>
<p>The credit card issuers generate a unique PIN for every credit card and share it with the cardholder once the card is issued. Earlier, banks used to send the PIN through PIN mailer. But now they prefer green PINs which are self-generated by the cardholder. The PIN generation process is different for each bank and the same will be communicated to the cardholder once the card is activated. </p>
<p>Once you receive the PIN, you can start using your credit card. Especially at POS terminals, you need to input the PIN once your card is dipped/swiped and the amount is entered. While some online transactions may require the PIN, others may ask for other security info such as CVV or one-time password. For ATM withdrawals, you can follow the same process as you do to withdraw cash using your debit card. The same PIN needs to be entered when necessary. </p>



<h2 id="Features_of_Credit_Cards">Features of a Credit Card</h2>

<p>Banks offer amazing features on their credit cards. These features vary depending on the card provider and the type of credit card that people purchase. Some of them are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Reward Points Program:</strong> Most credit cards offer a reward points program, which allows cardholders to earn reward points on every transaction they make using their cards. A few exceptions to it is that fuel transactions, insurance payments, gold or gold jewellery purchases, utility bill payments, cash and EMI transactions are typically not eligible for reward points. </p>
<p>The accrued reward points can be redeemed for various options offered in exclusive rewards catalogues provided by the issuers. However, card members need to earn minimum reward points before going for redemption. </p>
<p><strong>Airport Lounge Access:</strong> Complimentary airport lounge access and membership to Priority Pass Program are one of the most common features offered on most credit cards. Though you may not find the features on a basic credit card, most next to basic credit card offers complimentary lounge access with a limited number of visits per year, free membership to airport priority pass programs and others. With such a feature on credit card, members can enjoy free lounge visits to both domestic and international airports. </p>
<p><strong>Fuel Surcharge Waiver:</strong> Another common aspect offered on most credit cards is the fuel surcharge waiver facility that waives off the 1% surcharge that is typically charged on all card transactions conducted at petrol stations. </p>
<p><strong>Insurance Coverage:</strong> While some premier cards provide a comprehensive insurance policy that provides coverage against air accident, life, lost baggage, lost card, outstanding, etc. On other cards, the cover is limited to a few aspects. </p>
<p><strong>Global Acceptance:</strong> Today, most credit cards that are issued in India are international cards and are accepted by various merchants all over the world.</p>
<p><strong>Balance Transfer:</strong> Credit cardholders can transfer the outstanding balance of their existing cards issued by one bank to the credit card account of another bank. Doing so helps them in saving money and repaying the amount at a low rate of interest. Banks offer various balance transfer options to their cardholders allowing them to repay the amount on a monthly basis within a tenure of their choice.</p>
<p><strong>EMI Conversion:</strong> The feature allows the credit card members to convert their credit card transaction into easy monthly instalments (EMI). They can either choose to convert the total outstanding on their card into EMI, a specific transaction, especially big-ticket purchases into EMI and can also convert merchant transactions into EMI.Generally, these plans have very attractive interest rates and different repayment tenures. The EMI conversion will be done with no other documentation and most of the times instant. </p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle Benefits:</strong> By partnering with various merchants, credit card issuers provide attractive discounts and offers on various lifestyle categories including dining, shopping, travel, wellness, entertainment, etc. </p>
<p><strong> Travel Benefits:</strong> Frequent travellers can make the best use of the travel credit cards that provide travel-related benefits to the cardholders. Some of the common benefits offered on travel credit cards include air miles accrual and redemption for air tickets, free travel insurance, discount offers on domestic and international flights, complimentary lounge visits, discounts on hotel booking, and concierge services. </p>



<h2>Benefits of a Credit Card</h2>
<p><strong>Welcome Gift</strong> â€“ Many banks offer a welcome gift to new credit card applicants once the card is issued to them. This gift can be in the form of bonus points, gift vouchers, discounts, etc. The welcome gift differs depending on the card and the bank.</p>
<p><strong>Rewards Program</strong> â€“ All credit cards generally have a reward program, which allows cardholders to earn reward points on every transaction they make using their cards. The amount of points that cardholders can earn per transaction is fixed and differs from card to card. The points that card members collect can be redeemed for various gifts that are listed in the rewards catalogue of the cards. These gifts can be discounts, product, services, cashback offers, etc. Some credit cards allow card members to redeem their points against air miles and cash as well.</p>
<p><strong>Fuel Surcharge Waiver</strong> â€“ Many banks offer fuel surcharge waiver to credit cardholders when they spend specific amount of money on fuel every month. This offer is available on fuel transactions made at all Indian petrol bunks.</p>
<p><strong>Cashback Benefits</strong> â€“ There are certain credit cards that offer cashback benefits to the customers. The amount of cashback that will be offered depends on the provider.</p>
<p><strong>Lifestyle Benefits</strong> â€“ Cardholders can enjoy various lifestyle benefits on their credit cards. Lifestyle benefits include dining, shopping, golf, wellness, entertainment, etc. privileges.</p>
<p><strong>Travel Benefits</strong> â€“ This is one of the major reasons for credit cards being so popular among people. There are some credit cards that offer amazing travel benefits to the customers. Travel benefits include air miles, airport lounge access, travel insurance, airline offers, hotel offers, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Airport Lounge Access</strong> â€“ Some credit cards offer complimentary airport lounge access to the cardholders. The offer varies from one bank to another. Some banks put a limit on the number of visits, while some others allow access only to Indian airport lounges.</p>
<p><strong>Exclusive Privileges from Visa/American Express/MasterCard</strong> â€“ Visa, MasterCard and American Express are three popular and recognized credit card variants. Depending on the variant of your card, you can enjoy exclusive lifestyle, travel, etc. offers from MasterCard/Visa/American Express.</p>
<p><strong>Add-on Cards</strong> â€“ Many banks allow their credit cardholders to apply for add-on cards for their immediate family members. Most card issuers offer add-on cards for free, but some of them limit the amount of add-on cards that one can apply for. Cardholders can enjoy all the privileges of their primary cards on their add-on cards.</p>
<p id="Credit_Cards_in_India"><strong>Air Miles</strong> â€“ Certain credit cards such as travel or Airline cards offer Air Miles to their customers. These miles can be JPMiles, Air India Air Miles, etc. Cardholders can collect these miles and redeem them to avail flight tickets and other travel benefits.</p>

<h2>Credit Card Interest-Free Period</h2>

<p>Also called grace period, the interest-free period on a credit card ranges from 20 to 50 days depending on the scheme applicable on the credit card. However, the grace period is not applicable if the previous month's due has not been paid in full or if the cardholder has availed the cash withdrawal facility.</p>
<h2>Credit Card Billing Cycle</h2>

<p>Once a credit card is issued, 30 days from the date of issuance, the issuer will generate a monthly statement which is also called credit card statement, which shows all the transactions done on the card as transactions debited to the account and any payments made towards the card as credited transactions. The statement will be mailed to the cardholders every month on a predetermined date. However, if the outstanding balance is less than a certain cut-off, say Rs.200, no statement will be generated.</p>

<p>The cardmember has a facility of revolving credit in which he/she can pay only the minimum amount due, as printed on the statement, or the total amount due, or anything in between. If the payment is less than the total amount due, the remaining amount will be carried forward to subsequent statements. The carried forward amount will attract interest at the prevailing rate. All the payments, however, should be made on or before the due date to avoid late payment charges. </p>

<h2 id="Credit_Card_Eligibility">Credit Card Eligibility</h2>
<p>The eligibility criteria to apply for a credit card differs for each bank and also for each credit card. While the basic credit cards with nominal annual fee and minimal features require basic eligibility like constant source of income, good credit history or credit score, etc., the mid and premier range cards, which offer premier benefits and features, are typically issued to select group of people who meet the fixed criteria for income, credit score, and other parameters. To know your eligibility for a specific credit card, you can use the â€˜Check Eligibilityâ€™ feature offered on most bank websites. You can also use the same feature on Bankbazaar.com.

<h2>How to calculate EMI for Credit Cards</h2>
<p>Credit Cardholders can choose to convert certain transactions of theirs into monthly instalments. Card providers allow customers to choose the repayment period for their EMI (Equated Monthly Instalment) plans. Some banks nowadays offer 0% interest instalment payment plans to their credit cardholders. According to this plan, no interest is charged on the monthly instalments, which means cardholders have to pay the principal amount in parts within the tenure they have chosen.</p>
<p>Some banks charge a low interest rate on the EMI plans of credit cards. In this case, the EMI amount comprises of the principal amount and the interest rate. So, every month cardholders are supposed to repay this amount, until they clear off their debt. They can calculate their instalment amount per month before applying for the plan by using an EMI Calculator online. This calculator will help them in figuring out how much they will be paying every month if they opted for a certain EMI plan.

<p id="Airlinescards">Banks charge a particular percentage as the interest rate on the borrowed amount and this is applicable if the monthly outstanding amount has not been repaid by the card holder. The interest rate is calculated as the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) and always depends on the type of credit card held. The applicable finance charges are determined on a monthly interest rate percentage and is generally calculated on the average daily balance basis for credit cards. While picking up a credit card, customer can always compare the APRs offered on each card and then choose according to their requirements. Customers who can make regular monthly repayments, can choose credit cards with rewards programs and travel loyalty programs. These type of credit cards tend to have a slightly higher APR. If a customer is looking for flexibility with regards to payments and mainly for purchases, then a credit card with a lower APR should be taken. The APR is always determined based on the applicantâ€™s credit score by any financial institution. All banks offer an interest free period ranging from 20 to 50 days to credit card holders as an additional feature.</p>

The other copy is yours to take away from this transaction.</li>
              <li>Safe, comprehensive and fast, all of these steps were affected in less than 2 minutes. Neat, right?</li>

            <p>Borrowing from a popular axiom, â€˜With great power comes great responsibilityâ€™, and the same holds very true in the case of credit cards. While a handy financial help, a source of ready cash and a safe and beneficial way to pay for your purchases, the misuse of this facility could be detrimental to your long term financial health. Credit card debt, defaulting on your monthly repayments or drawing up a massive pile of credit card purchases and consequently, a stiff interest rate are things to be constantly aware of. The best way to enjoy your credit card is responsibly and with caution and tolerance. While the temptation may be high to unleash a shopping spree with your brand new credit card, remember, the money you spend is not your own- it must be returned back, with interest and on time!!</p></div>

            <h3>Tips to protect your Credit Card</h3>
            <p>Here's how to avoid physical damage to your Credit Card and ensure a long, healthy life.</p>
            <p><strong>Magnetic Strip</strong></p>
            <p>The most important part of your card is the magnetic strip on it. Exposing it to magnets or strong magnetic fields might stop the card from working. Keep it safe.</p>
            <p><strong>Extreme Temperatures</strong></p>
            <p>Too much heat or cold isn't good for your card. Room temperature - cool!</p>
            <p><strong>No Bending</strong></p>
            <p>Avoid storing your card in a location or manner that will result in bending or scratching the card.</p>
            <p><strong>Protective Cover</strong></p>
            <p>Most banks provide a protective sleeve along with the Credit Card to store it in. Use it.</p>
            <p>It isn't all that difficult, right? Just some precaution and your card will stay with you for a long time. Take a look at our offers on Credit Cards.</p>

            <h3>Lesser known Credit Card facts</h3>
            <p>Applying for a Credit Card and using it are fairly simple tasks. But is that all there is to it? Read on to find out a few lesser-known facts about Credit Cards. Don't have a card yet?</p>
            <p><strong>Impacts Two Aspects Of Your Credit Report</strong></p>
            <p>Credit Cards rule your Credit Score. Your payment history has a 35% impact on your Credit Score and the credit utilisation metric has a 30% impact. Your Credit Card usage impacts both.</p>
            <p><strong>Cover All Bases</strong></p>
            <p>Make sure that your Credit Card issuer reports your credit activities to all four credit bureaus in India. Not all card issuers share information with all the four bureaus.</p>
            <p><strong>An Unpaid Credit Card Bill Doesn't Affect Your Score</strong></p>
            <p>Bogus! Not paying your Credit Card dues will only send your Credit Score spiralling downwards. Always pay your dues in full if you want to see your score in the elite 750+ range.</p>
            <p><strong>Closing A Credit Card Account Is Not Always Good</strong></p>
            <p>Closing a Credit Card account can reduce the total credit available to you. This can raise your credit utilisation ratio above the acceptable 30% mark and bring down your Credit Score.</p>
            <p>Get a Credit Card that suits your lifestyle, spend wisely and pay your dues on time. Then watch the magic unfold.</p>

            <p>Splurging on clothes that you canâ€™t really afford is a very bad idea. Remember, you still have to repay the bank.</p>
            <p><strong>Teleshopping</strong></p>

            <p> Cash remains the preferred choice of payment for most of us. However, going cashless is a better option. Weâ€™ll tell you why. If you agree, explore our offers right away.</p>
            <p><strong>Goodbye, Queue</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Ciao, Cheques</strong></p>
            <p>Getting paid via cheques is a headache. In a cashless society, you donâ€™t have to go to the bank to deposit the cheque or wait for cheque to be credited. Quick money, it is!</p>
            <p><strong>Au Revoir, Risk</strong></p>
            <p>When you go cashless, there is less risk as compared to carrying a lot of currency notes in your wallet or bag.</p>
            <p><strong>Adios, Fraud</strong></p>
            <p>A cashless mechanism can help plug the loopholes in the public systems, prevent black money, smother grey economy and increase tax compliance.</p>

            <h3>4 Reasons Why Credit Cards Rule</h3>
            <p>Some say that Credit Cards are the new way of life. Now that may be a little far-fetched but Credit Cards are definitely becoming everybodyâ€™s favourite. Here are the reasons why:</p>
            <p><strong>Helps Beat the Rising Cost Of Living</strong></p>
            <p>Spendthrifts say Credit Cards lead to debt. The rest are using their cards to earn rewards, cashback and special discounts on purchases, cushioning the pressure arising out of the rising cost of living.</p>
            <p><strong>Affords You Luxury</strong></p>
            <p>Everything is sold at a marked-up price nowadays and paying in full will definitely burn a big hole in your pocket. Smart Credit Card users break their big buys into affordable EMIs.</p>
            <p><strong>Best Form of Instant Loan</strong></p>
            <p>Instead of borrowing, wise people pay for small, unexpected expenses with their Credit Card. There is a grace period from your time of purchase to the payment due date in which you can pay it all off without any interest.</p>
            <p><strong>Keep Track Of Every Penny</strong></p>
            <p>A  Credit Card statement is a record all your purchases. Study it every month and youâ€™ll be able to plug the leaks before they become too big.</p>

            <p><strong>Weâ€™ve always said that Credit Cards make excellent financial friends. Get a card, utilise it wisely and youâ€™ll know it yourself. Go on!</strong></p>

            <h3>Unlock happiness: Get a Credit Card</h3>
            <p>â€˜Money canâ€™t buy happiness.â€™ We beg to differ. With everyone going cashless, itâ€™s time to join the brigade. Get a Credit Card, mate!</p>
            <p><strong>Experiences Matter</strong></p>
            <p>Spending on experiences rather than material things tends to make you happier. For example, shopping alone versus a hiking trip with friends. What makes you happier?</p>
            <p> <strong>A Smile Is Worth Millions</strong></p>
            <p>Do something to make someone smile. Being the reason for someone elseâ€™s happiness is a great feeling. Every little effort counts.</p>
            <p><strong>Buy Time and Use It</strong></p>
            <p>Weâ€™re not talking about a time machine, duh! Take a vacation with the ones who matter to you or go solo. Travelling can make you happy.</p>
            <p><strong>Little Joys > Expensive Stuff</strong></p>
            <p>Spend more on the simple joys of life. A long drive, your favourite ice cream and someone you love. It beats shopping for expensive stuff.</p>

            <p><strong>See? Money can make you happy if you use it right - with the perfect Credit Card, of course!</strong></p>

            <p>Choosing the right Credit Card is as easy as 1-2-3. We tell you how. Or wait! Do you already know how to choose a Credit Card that suits your needs?</p>
            <p><strong>Annual Fee</strong></p>
            <p>If you hate charges, choose one with zero annual fees. Annual fees can go as high as Rs. 9,999 but you get a bunch of benefits, unlike free cards.</p>
            <p> <strong>Rewards</strong></p>
            <p>Fuel surcharge waiver - check. Cashback - check. Reward points - check. Free vouchers - check. Choose the card that gives you the rewards that you want.</p>
            <p><strong>APR</strong></p>
            <p>Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the interest charged on your Credit Card balance. The lower the APR, the better.</p>
            <p><strong>Joining Bonus</strong></p>
            <p>Who doesnâ€™t love being pampered? Most cards give you vouchers, reward points or free movie/air tickets as joining bonus. Choose one that works for you.</p>

            <h3>Effective TIPS to use your Credit Card</h3>
            <p>Using a Credit Card requires a little more than swiping and punching the PIN. It takes some self-control and some thought. Here are some tips to keep in mind. You could take a look at our offers in the meantime.</p>
            <p><strong>Make Small Purchases</strong></p>
            <p>Once you get a Credit Card do not let it sit idle. Make small purchases, which can be easily repaid. This will help you build a good credit score.</p>
            <p> <strong>Balance Control</strong></p>
            <p>Using up all your credit every month is not ideal financial behaviour. Stick to utilising 30-35 percent of your credit limit. Itâ€™ll enhance your Credit Score.</p>
            <p><strong>Take It Easy</strong></p>
            <p>You can have as many Credit Cards as you like. Just be mindful to leave a gap of a few months between each application. You donâ€™t want to appear desperate, do you?</p>
            <p><strong>Guard It with Your Life</strong></p>
            <p>Your Credit Card details are precious. Once you get your card, do not flash it around. Keep it securely in your wallet and do not divulge the PIN to anybody.</p>

            <p><strong>With these tips, you should be ready to get a Credit Card. Get started, right away.</strong></p>

            <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Credit Card Shopping Checklist </strong></p>
            <p>Credit Cards are a convenient financial option if you don&rsquo;t want to carry too much cash with you on that shopping spree. Here are a few factors to consider when you choose your perfect Credit Card.</p>
            <p><strong>Interest Rates</strong></p>
            <p>Interest on your Credit Card is charged on a yearly basis. It is a fee that you pay for using the card. It&rsquo;s a good idea to opt for a card with a fixed interest rate that remains the same every month.</p>
            <p><strong>Annual Fees</strong></p>
            <p>Credit Cards have an annual fee that is charged to the cardholder. Some charges that are included as a part of the annual fee are late payment charges, cash advances, any requests for increased credit limit and balance transfer.</p>
            <p><strong>Grace Period </strong></p>
            <p>A grace period is the number of days you will get to pay your Credit Card bill after the due date. The grace period is usually 30-50 days to clear any outstanding dues.</p>
            <p><strong>Cash Withdrawal </strong></p>
            <p>Credit Cards come with an ATM PIN so that you can get cash through your Credit Card from an ATM. But, remember that cash withdrawals on your Credit Card attract high interest rates.</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">Have you found a Credit Card that suits you yet?</p>
